      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Hope for Children is a certified charity, serving residents throughout
        all fifty states and the District of Columbia, mainly providing training
        and emergency services and contacts to help end child abuse and abuse to
        others.Based on the data gathered from the design thinking user-centric
        analysis, our team redesigned the navigation, layout, and UI to better
        convey the purpose and raise awareness and money to protect children
        from domestic violence and sexual assault.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The current website is unclear in its goal, outdated in its aesthetics,
        and had less clarity and organization with the information. As a result,
        users struggled to find the information they need to have and trust the
        organization to dedicate more resources to the cause.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal was to redesign the Hope for Children website to convey their
        valuable mission and activities in a more clear, concise, and enticing
        manner in order to motivate individuals to donate, volunteer, or spread
        the word about Hope for Children initiatives.

          <h3 class="paraheader">Knowing the Users</h3>
          <p>
            Our team gathered qualitative data from 5 user interviews and
            website testing. Quantitative data was also gathered through a
            survey sent out via email and social media over a period of 2 days.
            By speaking with interviewees and gathering participant responses
            through our survey, we were able to understand their pain points and
            goals related to non-profit efforts, as well as what would motivate
            them to volunteer, donate, or otherwise become informed or involved
            in different organizations.
          </p>
          <p>Key intakes directly from the users:</p>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/User Interviews.png" />
          <h3>Usability test of the current website</h3>
          <p>
            Using the same interviewees, we then proceeded by instructing them
            to test the usability of the current website. The goal of our
            usability test was to gather as much information and feedback to
            understand how our real users interacted with the product and
            understand their specific pain points related to the current
            navigation, layout and aesthetic of the website.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Define" class="subheader">2. Define</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/persona.png" />
          <p>
            With the pain points identified, we then reviewed and revised our
            persona based on the data collected and reframed those pain points
            as possible opportunities. Our persona is Patrick Poe, who is a busy
            family man. Patrick is not regularly looking for volunteering
            opportunities and prefers donating instead of volunteering. However,
            he is wary of donating online as he is worried about organizations
            not being legitimate. He is also not sure if the money is going
            directly to the people in need. We then used those pain points to
            determine user insights.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">User Insight</h3>
          <p>
            Our user, Patrick Poe, is not very inclined to actively contribute
            to causes and prefers to donate money. However, he is also wary of
            donating online unless he has first hand knowledge of the
            organization’s work and is certain its mission and causes are
            legitimate — preferably he would like to see this with his own eyes.
            He mostly finds out about causes by word of mouth and needs to know
            he can trust an organization and platform in order to dedicate more
            resources to a cause. Overall, he lacks incentives to become more
            actively involved in NPOs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Our user is wary of unknown non-profit organizations and, though he
            sometimes donates to select causes, is overall unlikely to volunteer
            his time. Currently, he does not feel he can trust organizations and
            their online platforms and is hesitant to dedicate more resources to
            causes.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Ideate" class="subheader">3. Ideate</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Storyboard</h3>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/Storyboard.png" />
          <p>
            As we started brainstorming more, we made a visual storyboard to
            study how our user can trust and donate confidently using the
            website. In the storyboard, Patrick has been scammed before, while
            donating. But with some credible education about looking for
            accredited organizations, Patrick feels comfortable donating again.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Information Architecture</h3>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/information architecture.png" />
          <p>
            Later, as we discussed and tested more on how to improve this
            website, we first began with I like, I wish, What if? from the data
            collected. We then voted and rated and came up with our most
            relevant features like: a volunteer profile and a clear place to
            donate using our prioritization matrix. Three new features were
            identified: Volunteer Profiles, Donate By Category & Success
            Stories.
          </p>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/new features.png" />
          <h3 class="paraheader">Card Sorting</h3>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/card sorting.jpeg" />
          <p>
            The next step was to simplify the navigation system so that users
            can easily navigate to the crucial parts of the website. We used
            Card Sorting technique to generate the Information
            Architecture.Based on the information gathered during research and
            persona phase, we were able to decide the main categories. We
            iterated more than 7 times and finally agreed on the 8th iteration.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Site Map</h3>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/SITEMAP.png" />
          <h3 class="User Flow">User Flow</h3>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/USER FLOW.png" />
          <p>
            Mapping the basic flow helped us understand the path the users will
            take to complete the goal in the most efficient way.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Style Tile</h3>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/Style Tile.png" />
          <p>
            While choosing the design, we were cautious as we wanted it to be
            simple yet youthful, and resonate with a hopeful and uplifting feel.
            We found this specific color palette to be very calming, positive,
            encouraging and brought all the elements of innocence. From here, we
            later developed the UI Style Guide by taking our diverse wireframe
            elements and putting them into formats that were consistent with
            spacing, color, font, and overall style.
          </p>
          <h2 id="Prototype" class="subheader">4. Prototype</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Wireframe Sketches</h3>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/wireframe sketches.png" />
          <p>
            Now that we have got an idea of different pages and what they should
            include, using the user flow as the guide we drew out some wireframe
            sketches, mainly focused on the key critical content/features pages
            and created low fi prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of us decided to work on different parts of the user flow
            section. My role was to add a new volunteer section because it added
            transparency and increased motivation and trust as users could see
            the real picture and how others are visibly involved. With a couple
            of ideas flowing into my mind based on the insights received from
            the user interviews and paper sketches, I immediately started my
            design process for the following screens.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              General Volunteer page including info about different volunteer
              opportunities, “meet our volunteers” and “upcoming events”.
            </li>
            <li>An overlay card showing info of the selected volunteer.</li>
            <li>Sign Up Page</li>
            <li>Sign Up Confirmation Page</li>
            <li>Sign In Page</li>
            <li>Profile Page</li>
            <li>Profile confirmation page</li>
            <li>Low Fi & Mid Wireframes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We then did some tests based on our user flow to find out if our
            usability was good and if users could understand the flow. Based on
            the data received we started creating low fi wireframes. Below is
            the progression of some of the main screens from low fi to mid fi.
          </p>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/low-mid fis.png" />
          <h2 id="Test" class="subheader">5. Test</h2>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h3 class="paraheader">Hi-Fidelity Usability Testing</h3>
          <img class="contentimage" src="images/testing.png" />
          <p>
            Though it never came up as a usability issue in any of the tests, I
            realized it is not a good practice to extend a page if not required.
            Based on that, I changed the layout of some of the volunteer web
            pages, and it also helped to achieve a better look and feel that I
            was looking for.
          </p>
          <h3 class="paraheader">AB Testing</h3>
          <img class="secondimage" src="images/A-B testing.png" />
          <p>
            Lastly, we did an A/B to determine the preference between two hero
            images. We were interested in knowing how users reacted to specific
            images and which image they were able to connect more.There was no
            notable difference between the two, but most testers’ preference was
            of the image of the family. With that final iteration, we were able
            to conclude and finish the last step of the project.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="paraheader">Final Design</h3>
      <img class="contentimage" src="images/final design.png" />
      <p>
        The updated and iterated hifi prototype now provides better and quick
        access to the web page’s newly added relevant contents and lets users
        see true success stories, volunteer pages, and create an account. Our
        prototype also scales up to the desktop in a responsive manner.
      </p>
      <img class="contentimage" src="images/comparing screens.png" />
      <p>
        Our homepage provides direct access to our main features: About Us /
        Volunteer section / Success Stories / Donation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The menu system was designed to be as straightforward as possible. Each
        page includes our volunteer sign in and donate page — (to consistently
        emphasize ways for our user to get involved).

              Similarly, this section allows people to see specific ways the
              organization has helped. It also includes information on which
              donation causes and volunteer efforts went towards these successes
              — again aiming to provide transparency for donors and increase
              trust and involvement. Show donors and volunteers how their
              involvement contributed to helping others.

        About Us — This section pulls together previously scattered and
        overwhelming information about the organization and the sponsors — to
        increase trust for the organization and create a reliable presence. It
        also shows the Sponsors, Partners, and Supporters
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteer — The volunteer section is extensive and focused on the real
        people involved — It acts as a way to increase both motivation and trust
        because users can see that others are visibly involved. There is also a
        gold level for those who volunteer more, to add to the motivational
        aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Donate — Our donate page has general donations and donations by category
        — so donors can directly see where their money would be going, which was
        a user goal we uncovered in our research.

      <h3 id="Summary" class="paraheader">Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Redesigning this webpage has been both challenging and rewarding. Our
        overall goal with the redesign was to present a helpful, uplifting feel
        throughout and make resources easy to find. It was clear from the start
        that the major challenge would be to make the website credible and
        trustable in order to motivate users to donate and volunteer. I believe
        we successfully made the web page intuitive and engaging from both
        users’ and organization’s perspectives by redesigning, adding, and
        enhancing the new features.
      </p>
      <p class="paraheader">
        As I continue with my learnings and gain more experience in the UX
        field, I would like to revisit this project and add a few things.
      </p>
      <p>Invest more time in research about specific features</p>
      <p>More user testing & iterations to perfect the page</p>
      <p>
        Make the pages more interactive (Animations, Changes in actions taken,
        etc)
